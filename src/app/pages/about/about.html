      <h1>About Bharat Security</h1>

        Bharat Security is a cybersecurity firm focused on manual-first penetration testing,
        incident response, and real-world security assurance.

    <!-- STORY -->
    <section class="block">
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        We started Bharat Security with a simple belief: automated tools alone do not secure modern
        systems. Real security comes from understanding how attackers think, how systems fail, and
        how humans make mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our work is rooted in hands-on testing, practical exploitation, and clear communication —
        not fear, not noise.
